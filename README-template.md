## My process

### Built with

- Bootstrap
- Jquery
- Sass
- MutationObserver
- Webpack


### What I learned

This was a fun application to make! I actually started this project a while back and decided to set it aside so I could focus on learning Jquery and Bootstrap in a smaller more manageable project. 

When I came back to this project, I felt more confident with those two technologies but needed to simply role with what I had already created and balance it with what I had learned in the mean time. 

I felt good about creating reusable functions that all quiz subjects could utilize. After I had built everything in my JS file, I thought about how I could optimize it even more. 

I also learned about the MutationObserver API which I used for adding utility classes for my dynamically added elements. In the future I want to learn more about this API and other API's and how they can help with my work flow. 

### Continued development

From this point on I would like to maybe venture into React. I know that React could have made this project even easier with components and state management.
